# 🐱 Cat vs Non-Cat
Here we have 3 notebooks, with logitic regression and neural network models. They're quite simple, and were trained on just 209 images and validaded on 50 other images, although, data augmentation was used to duplicate the size of the training set. The best performing model was the convolutional neural network, with an accuracy of about 84% on the test set (here we don't have a validation set).

## 📋 Problem Description
The Cat vs Non-Cat problem is a classic machine learning challenge where we need to build a model that can accurately classify images as either cat or non-cat.

## 📂 Repository Structure
**data/**: This directory contains the dataset used for training and evaluation. The train_catvnoncat.h5 file includes the labeled data for training the model, while the test_catvnoncat.h5 file contains the unlabeled data for predictions.

**utils/**: This directory contains utility functions and helper scripts used in the project.

***.ipynb**: Notebook containing a different model to classify the images.
