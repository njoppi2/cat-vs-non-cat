# 🐱 Cat vs Non-Cat
Here is a simple react website I made just to interact with the deployed API. To access it, click [here](https://njoppi2.github.io/cat-vs-non-cat/).

## 👟 Running the website

1. **Run**: `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
