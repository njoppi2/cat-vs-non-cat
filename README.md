# Cat vs Non-Cat Classification
This GitHub repository contains the latest solution I made for the Cat vs Non-Cat classification problem. The goal of this project is to train a machine learning model that can classify images as either cats or non-cats.

## ðŸ“‹ Problem Description
The Cat vs Non-Cat problem is a classic machine learning challenge where we need to build a model that can accurately classify images as either cat or non-cat.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
**data/**: This directory contains the dataset used for training and evaluation. The train_catvnoncat.h5 file includes the labeled data for training the model, while the test_catvnoncat.h5 file contains the unlabeled data for predictions.

**utils/**: This directory contains utility functions and helper scripts used in the project.

***.ipynb**: Notebook containing a different model to classify the images.
